The first challenge from my committee was to build a 'minimal working example' of people acting on behalf of states, _a la_[Colin Wight's concept][0] of 'structural relationsim'. There's not nearly enough there to build a world out of. 

To be fair, Wight was just working through the philosophical challenges in the 'agent-structure debate' in International Relations, not specifying a model. That was my idea. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9b53dcf8-d7df-4f64-8cc4-141f6ca24821.png)

I threw away several paper-and-pen drafts of the model, sketched out roughly with UML (unified modeling language). This version (made with [plantUML][1]) comes a lot closer, but it's still lacking connections with the environment. 

I spent a great deal of time wrestling with the relationship between institutions and organizations. I eventually came across [this paper][2] by Geoffrey Hodgson, helpfully titled, "What are institutions?" It was convincing enough to make me model the world with organizations being a type of institution. I'm not yet certain that I can leave it this way, however. Consider this: institutions are made by people (are socially-constructed, emergent artifacts) whereas organizations are made of and by people. So this is a problem that I have yet to solve.
