Yesterday, I defended a proposal to my dissertation committee at George Mason University. I want to model world orders by simulating the social mechanisms that culminate to create it. I think this is important for a host of reasons, most of them related war. 

War is a problem. I didn't say that in my proposal. I stuck mainly to the technical challenges of designing the model and the computing architecture required to run such a simulation; how to build it, not why. 

There's also an important question about how we (individuals, societies, polities) identify with the institutions that order the world. I'm going to argue that a great deal of organized conflict is about political identity and whether we're happy with the relationship between that identity and the world order. 

The current world order, commonly called the liberal world order, is a system in which the governments of nation-states have divided (almost) the entirety of our planet into common areas and sovereign territories. Almost everybody in the world lives in a place that is controlled by a national government. That's an over-simplified way to describe the current world order, but it's just an introduction to a complicated idea. Anyway, not everybody is satisfied with where the polity they identify with is situated in the world order. 

We came into with this system after World War II. WWII was a really big war that represents the end of an era when empires held the world order. World War I was another really big war that represents beginning of the end of the age of empires. Did you notice that both of those really big wars happened along with major shifts in world order? I did, too. The close relationship between major shifts in world order and really big wars deserves a closer look. Did you think about sociological changes that coincided with those big shifts, too? ...decolonization, rise of the working class, urban migration... Nowadays, we talk about the fragility of states where the social structures that order power are unstable. 

But, we can't really blame fragility for war. War is not just something that happens when order breaks down. War is something we build up to. We prepare for it, plan for it, invest in it. We organize ourselves to make war. 

Clausewitz called war, "politics by other means". I suspect that the truth of that observation is deeper than even he realized. There is some relationship between social structure, war and world order. I think it needs to be studied. To study it, I need a laboratory built to the purpose. I am going to build a model of world order out of the things world order is really made of: people.
