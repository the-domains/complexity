Last week, Michael Smith and I presented some work we've been doing together on learning analytics at the Military Operations Research Society's [84th Symposium][0]. It's good to get out.

Mike and I have worked together for years, though not on learning analytics. We were working on strategy at the U.S. Department of Defense. We were similarly frustrated with the plodding slow pace at which DoD adapts to change. We each left to find more interesting things to do. Mike discovered that instructional design and learning analytics researchers were excited about the things computational and data sciences could do for them. Last year, when the [company][1] he was working for had some contract work, I got an opportunity to sign on as an on-call consultant. 

There's a team of people working on it, actually, but Mike is the energy behind computational analytics for this project. It's been fun and fairly distracting from my research, but it was a great opportunity to apply computational social science prescriptively: simulating students taking online courses, so that their progress and experience can be tracked and analyzed.
