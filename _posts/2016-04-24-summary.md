# Summary 

I propose to develop a multi-level agent-based model of international relations and demonstrate its use by simulating several scenarios about alternative, future world orders. The model for international relations is based primarily on Colin Wight's theory of structural relationism--a theory of IR (international relations) which explains that states exist as a totality of social inter- actions (ideational and material) and that their behavior depends on the agency of individuals representing them (Wight 2006). Implementing the model as an agent-based simulation will help answer the question whether Wight's theory is tractable. Using the model to simulate predictive scenarios about future world orders will help determine the utility of Wight's theory for studying IR and should provide some insights about those postulated futures. Simulating IR as social interactions between individual people is not trivial. Wight provides a theory and an ontology but implementing it in a simulation is computationally challenging. In order to implement the model in silico, I will leverage a combination of existing formal models to reduce the scale of the simulation and apply recent advances in distributed computing. This project will rely on an IMDG (in-memory data grid)--a recent advance in parallel computing for big data that allows a cluster of computers to share their combined primary memory as if they were a single computer and still allows parallel client sub-processes on each processor in the cluster. 

## Intellectual Merit 

Strategic thinking about complex, global issues like terrorism, poverty, environmental disaster or war needs to include the broad effects of social and environmental dynamics within the world system. This project provides a laboratory that represents a global context in which to study world affairs at a strategic level, with a particular interest in IR. Development of the laboratory itself contributes to three aspects of computational social science: advancing agent-based simulation by applying the multi-level paradigm to a global-scale model; demonstrating a new application of IMDGs to agent-based social simulations; and, providing a new tool with which researchers can develop and test social science theories and conduct policy analysis at a strategic level. The project will be grounded in empirical data, yet leverage existing social theory that is not predicated on this modeling technique. 

## Broader Implications 

The model design and its implementation are intended to be extensible so that the model has utility beyond this project. The laboratory will enable future model development and experimentation, allow study of new scenarios, implement alternate or additional agent behaviors, and include competing models of social and environmental change. This design will enable researchers from the various social science disciplines to situate their models in a global context in order to study cascading effects over time, space and into other areas of social life. This project promises to enhance agent-based modeling and simulation capabilities, generally. It demonstrates how the multi-level, agent-based modeling technique can incorporate emergence of meso-level agents within the system being modeled--instead of a "system of systems" it models a system of agents and the agent-like structures that agents create. Notably, it is an early (perhaps the first) example of using an IMDG computing architecture in agent-based simulations. As such, will be a boon for social scientists wanting to develop ABMs (agent-based models) with large agent populations.
