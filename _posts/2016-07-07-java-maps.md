  One of my side projects right now is to use figure out how to do agent-based
  simulation modeling (ABM) with in-memory data grids (like Hazelcast). A
  typical ABM assigns a behavior or reflex to agents based on their read of the
  environment. This usually happens by putting all of the code objects that
  represent agents into a list and iterating through the list to call on each
  object/agent to do some observation action, like counting neighbors or
  detecting a system state.

One of my side projects right now is to use figure out how to do agent-based simulation modeling (ABM) with in-memory data grids (like Hazelcast).

Hazelcast uses a Java 'map' to contain the objects/agents. And while the map is iterable (meaning you can start with one item in the map and turn to the next, then the next, then the next and so on... it does not easily 'subitize'. You cannot easily pick just a few items in the map and iterate through those. 

Today, I read a nice article from DZone on iterating with maps. This is getting easier with Java 8 and the solution was impressively simple. I haven't tried it yet, but I wanted to share it. [Take a look][0]!
