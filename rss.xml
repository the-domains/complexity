            <description><![CDATA[<p>The first challenge from my committee was to build a 'minimal working example' of people acting on behalf of states, a la Colin Wight's concept of 'structural relationsim'. There's not nearly enough there to build a world out of. </p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>One of my side projects right now is to use figure out how to do agent-based simulation modeling (ABM) with in-memory data grids (like Hazelcast). A typical ABM assigns a behavior or reflex to agents based on their read of the environment. This usually happens by putting all of the code objects that represent agents into a list and iterating through the list to call on each object/agent to do some observation action, like counting neighbors or detecting a system state. </p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I defended a proposal to my dissertation committee at George Mason University. I want to model world orders by simulating the social mechanisms that culminate to create it. I think this is important for a host of reasons, most of them related war. </p>]]></description>
